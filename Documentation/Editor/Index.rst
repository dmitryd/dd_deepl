For Editors
===========

Editors can translate content and records using DeepL.

Translating content happens as usual by pressing a "Translate" button in the Page module. Translation window will show and additional button named "Translate with DeepL":

For records each language for each available translation is duplicated and a new button with a DeepL icon on it appears:


..  figure:: /Images/ListModule.jpg
    :class: with-shadow
    :alt: List module
    :width: 500px


Records will get translations if combination of a source and a target language is supported by DeepL.
